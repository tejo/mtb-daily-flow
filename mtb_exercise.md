MTB Flow & Reactivity: 10-Minute Daily Routine
This program is specifically designed for active riders to maintain the reactivity, balance, and proprioception required for technical mountain biking and jumping.

Core Principles
Time: 10 Minutes (No rest between exercises).

Frequency: Every day (especially before a ride or right after waking up).

Focus: Quality of movement over quantity.

1. Dynamic Mobility (0:00 – 3:00)
Goal: Unlock the joints that control the bike's movement.

90/90 Hip Switches (1 min): Sit on the floor with your legs bent at 90 degrees. Rotate your knees from side to side without using your hands for support. Keep your torso as upright as possible.

World’s Greatest Stretch (1 min): From a deep lunge position, bring your inside elbow toward the floor, then rotate that same arm toward the ceiling. Alternate sides.

Wrist & Shoulder Rotations (1 min): Perform slow, controlled circles with your wrists and large rotations with your shoulders to lubricate the joints that absorb trail chatter.

2. Proprioception & Balance (3:00 – 6:00)
Goal: Train the nervous system to stabilize the body on a shifting platform.

Single Leg "Clock" Balance (1.5 min): Stand on one leg with the knee slightly bent (mimicking a pedal stroke). Use your floating foot to "tap" the hours 12, 3, 6, and 9 on an imaginary clock. Switch legs after 45 seconds.

Single Leg Isometric Deadlift (1.5 min): Hold a "T" position on one leg, hinging at the hip with a flat back. Focus on keeping your hips level.

Pro Challenge: Close your eyes for 5-10 seconds to force your inner ear and joints to work harder.

3. Reactivity & Soft Plyometrics (6:00 – 9:00)
Goal: Build the "pop" for jumps and the ability to absorb heavy landings.

Pogo Jumps (1.5 min): Bounce on the balls of your feet using primarily your ankles. Keep your knees relatively stiff. Aim for minimum ground contact time. (Perform 20s of jumping, 10s of rest, repeat 3 times).

Drop Squats (1.5 min): Start on your tiptoes with arms reaching up. Quickly "drop" into a deep Attack Position (athletic squat) and stick the landing instantly. Do not let your knees wobble.

4. Core Stability (9:00 – 10:00)
Goal: Create a solid chassis to prevent the bike from bucking you.

Dynamic Plank / Shoulder Taps (1 min): In a high plank (push-up) position, tap the opposite shoulder with your hand. The key is to keep your hips perfectly still—do not let them rock.
